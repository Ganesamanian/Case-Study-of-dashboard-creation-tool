## Conclusion

Advosense’s **sensa** system deals with sensor data from RFID and possibly image data, necessitating a tool that can handle time-series data and provide real-time insights. Grafana stands out as the best choice due to its open-source nature, real-time monitoring capabilities, and cost-effectiveness. While Tableau offers excellent features, its high price makes it less suitable in this scenario. Power BI's integration with Microsoft services is beneficial but not critical to the decision.

Grafana’s strengths in managing time-series data and providing real-time insights make it the optimal solution for Advosense.
